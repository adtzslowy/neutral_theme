Neutral theme is a refined dark theme inspired by the Nord color palette, redesigned with a neutral foundation to provide a calm, balanced, and distraction-free coding environment.

It combines cool Nordic tones with a carefully tuned neutral background to deliver clarity, consistency, and visual comfort across modern development workflows.
